## A fictional mobile network operator

This is an HTML5 project I did for high school in 2016.
Part of the requirements were to have a gallery of images, have different pages with navigation and to use responsive design.
I also added intergation with Google Maps but it displays "Development purposes only" since I did not pay for a licence.
